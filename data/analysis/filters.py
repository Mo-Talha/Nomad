IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT EMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATIONS:

It is the student's responsibility to ensure that they have the necessary documentation required by the country the job
is in to participate in this co-op work term. The University cannot provide related advice or arrange for this
documentation on a student's behalf. The student must work with the employer and/or the issuing authority of the
destination country to obtain this documentation. If the student cannot obtain the necessary documentation to
participate in the co-op work term, the student must find an alternate co-op opportunity. Working in a country without
the necessary documentation can have serious consequences, including, but without limitation, being fined or detained.
Any consequences that ensue from having inappropriate documentation are the student's responsibility.

*IMPORTANT NOTE FROM CECA RE: EMPLOYMENT OUTSIDE Canada and USA *

This work opportunity will be outside Canada and USA, and therefore will have certain financial realities.
Students should be aware that student salaries in countries outside North America are typically significantly
lower than Canadian minimum wages, and that it is unlikely that the local salary will allow for any significant level
of savings during the work term.

Also, international companies do not necessarily provide any additional compensation for airfare, work permit or
housing expenses. Sign-offs will not be permitted for financial reasons; so, please review what is covered or
not covered in the compensation details. Use a currency converter like http://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exchange
/daily-converter/  to understand the Canadian equivalent.  Students should assume that all expenses related to airfare,
work permit and housing will be the responsibility of the student.

Also, please go to https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/working-abroad/finding-international-job-opportunities
/are-you-eligible-work-abroad, and read the information listed in its entirety before you apply for this job. Please
be aware of mandatory and other requirements for students working outside Canada: https://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative
