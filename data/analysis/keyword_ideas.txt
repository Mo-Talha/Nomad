All of our engineering teams are hiring . We have a modern tech stack: Play (Scala), React, Swift,  MySQL, Cassandra, Solr, Kafka and all of it is hosted using Amazon Web Services. 

The employer could be doing several things while mentioning a keyword.

1. Ask for exprience in x (Ex. experience in SQL)
2. Develop/Design/Program/~Make in x (Ex. Develop in Ruby)
3. Past co-ops have worked with x
4. Our stack consists of x
5. Worked/Work with x (Ex. You have worked with Linux)
6. We/Company have/use languages such as x (Ex. We use Ruby)

Patterns:
Ultimately the employer is trying to tell us that they are interested in students with a specific skill (keyword)

1. Consecutive keywords increase probability of correct keyword
2. Standalone keywords may or may not be correct. Possible ways to check: look a few sentences before/after recursively
3. Otherwise, most employers seem to use words like: experience, familiar, knowledge, proficiency, ability, understanding, skills, 
4. Look for Required and Responsibilities, Qualifications tab (if applicable)
5. Detect keywords
